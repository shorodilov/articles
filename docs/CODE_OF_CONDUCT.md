# Code of Conduct

## Purpose Statement

This Code of Conduct establishes basic expectations for respectful and
constructive participation in this repository. While this is a
single-author technical publications repository, contributions,
feedback, and discussions are welcome from the broader community. This
document outlines the standards that govern interactions within issues,
pull requests, and any other collaborative spaces associated with this
project.

## Expected Behavior

Participants in this repository are expected to engage in good faith
and with respect. Constructive contributions include sharing feedback
on technical accuracy, suggesting improvements to clarity or structure,
and reporting issues in a helpful manner. Disagreements should be
approached professionally, focusing on ideas rather than individuals.
Questions and discussions should reflect a genuine interest in
learning, teaching, or improving the content. When offering criticism,
aim to be specific and actionable, recognizing the effort invested in
creating and maintaining these materials.

## Our Stance on the War in Ukraine

The maintainer of this repository is Ukrainian and stands with Ukraine
and the Ukrainian people in the ongoing war of aggression by the
Russian Federation. This repository condemns this illegal invasion and
the humanitarian crisis it has caused.

While contributors from around the world are welcome, all community
members must respect the values and dignity of the Ukrainian people.
Pro-war rhetoric, denial of war crimes, or justification of aggression
against Ukraine will not be tolerated in this repository's spaces.

This community is built on principles of peace, human rights, and
mutual respect. Those who cannot uphold these principles are not
welcome here.

## Unacceptable Behavior

This repository does not tolerate harassment, personal attacks,
trolling, doxxing, or any form of discriminatory behavior. Spam,
off-topic solicitations, and disruptive conduct are not permitted.
Intentional misrepresentation of facts, bad-faith arguments, or
repeated disregard for feedback after warnings will result in
enforcement action.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions within this
repository, including but not limited to issues, pull requests,
discussions, and comments. It also applies when individuals represent
this project in external forums or communications if such
representation is made explicitly or can be reasonably inferred.

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct will be addressed at the
maintainer's discretion. Responses may range from a warning or request
for clarification to immediate removal of content and restriction of
access. As this is a single-maintainer repository, enforcement will be
handled on a best-effort basis and decisions are final. The maintainer
is not obligated to provide detailed explanations for moderation
actions, though such explanations may be offered when appropriate.

## Contact

To report a Code of Conduct violation, contact the maintainer directly
via email at <EMAIL>. Reports will be handled with discretion to the
extent possible. Please include relevant context, links, or screenshots
to help assess the situation.
