# General Rules

## Repository Context

This is a publications repository for articles, essays, reviews, and other
written content. Single-author, best-effort maintenance model.

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity over complexity** — Prefer straightforward solutions. No
   elaborate error handling or overengineered abstractions. Clear logging
   and helpful messages are enough.

2. **Format flexibility** — Accept any plain text format. reStructuredText
   is primary, Markdown and plain text are equally valid.

3. **Minimal intervention** — Do not suggest complex workflows, extensive
   automation, or infrastructure changes unless explicitly requested.
