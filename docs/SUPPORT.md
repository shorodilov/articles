- There are no guaranteed response times or commitments
- All support is provided as time and capacity allow
- Responses and assistance are discretionary

## Support Channels

### GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues are the primary channel for questions, help requests, and
discussions. Use the following templates:

- **[Question / Help][question-template]** — For questions about repository
  content, technical topics covered in publications, or how to use the build
  system
- **[General / Other][general-template]** — For feedback, suggestions, or
  anything else not covered by other templates

Please note that GitHub Issues are public. Do not share sensitive or private
information through this channel.

[question-template]: ../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/07-question.md
[general-template]: ../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/08-general.md

### Email

For private matters that should not be discussed publicly, you may reach out
via email at {EMAIL}. Use email only when:

- The matter is confidential or sensitive
- You need to report a Code of Conduct concern (see
  [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct] for conduct-related reporting)

Please continue to use GitHub Issues for general questions and discussions
to benefit the broader community.

## What to Expect

I appreciate your interest and will make reasonable efforts to respond, but
please keep these expectations in mind:

- **Responses may be delayed** — Due to work, personal commitments, and
  other priorities, responses may take days or weeks
- **Not all requests can be fulfilled** — Some questions may go unanswered
  if they fall outside my expertise or available time
- **Prioritization is discretionary** — I prioritize based on relevance to
  the repository, complexity, and available capacity
- **Best-effort does not mean no effort** — It means no guarantees, but I
  value contributions and engagement

Your understanding and patience are appreciated.

## Out of Scope

The following are outside the support scope for this repository:

- **General technical consulting** — Questions unrelated to the repository
  content or publications
- **Urgent requests** — This is not a commercial project and cannot
  accommodate time-sensitive or emergency requests
- **Circumventing templates** — Please use the provided issue templates
  rather than ad-hoc methods of contact

public issues. Instead, refer to the [Security Policy][security] for proper
reporting procedures.

Security matters must be handled privately to protect users.
