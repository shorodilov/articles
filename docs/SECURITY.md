# Security Policy

## Overview

Security is an important aspect of maintaining this repository. While
this is a publications collection rather than a software project, we
are committed to addressing legitimate security concerns responsibly
and appreciate the efforts of researchers and contributors who help
identify potential issues.

## Scope

Security concerns in this repository are limited to specific areas:

- **Build scripts** — Vulnerabilities in automation or tooling
- **Exposed credentials or secrets** — Accidental inclusion of
  sensitive data
- **Repository infrastructure** — Issues with GitHub configurations or
  workflows

**Content accuracy issues are not security matters.** If you find
factual errors, outdated information, or other content problems, please
report them through the "Content Fix" issue template instead.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues.**

Use GitHub Security Advisories to report security concerns privately:

- https://github.com/shorodilov/publications/security/advisories/new

This ensures the issue can be assessed and addressed before public
disclosure.

## What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- **Description** — Clear explanation of the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** — How to observe or trigger the vulnerability
- **Potential impact** — What could be affected or compromised
- **Suggested remediation** — Optional, but helpful if you have ideas

## Response Expectations

Security reports are handled on a best-effort basis consistent with
this repository's maintenance model. There are no guaranteed response
times or service-level agreements, but legitimate security concerns are
taken seriously and will be addressed as capacity allows.

## Acknowledgment

Contributors who report valid security issues may be acknowledged in
release notes or commit messages if they wish, once the issue has been
resolved. Credit is optional and at the discretion of the reporter.
